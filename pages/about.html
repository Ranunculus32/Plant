        <b> Tina's Plant Collection</b> is a product of years of careful labor. It all started when I moved to Sweden, </br>
        three years ago. The garden we had is plain and almost empty, save for some bushes and wildflowers growing </br>
        here and there. At first I started buying plants from local garden centers but filling up our 800sqm lot takes</br> 
        a lot more  than I can afford. And so I started searching online for cheaper source. That's where I discovered that </br>
      buying roots and bulbs from Holland or UK is a lot cheaper. Every late summer and autumn, I ordered for </br>
      next year's garden bed. And three years later, I end up with multiple plants of different varieties. The </br>
      collection is growing as our lawn is shrinking. It will be many more years of buying and planting until I </br>
      I will have my ideal garden. But for now, I am very happy with the result and is glad to share my passion to you. </br>
